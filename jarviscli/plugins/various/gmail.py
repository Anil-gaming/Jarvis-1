# GMAIL ONLY
# ----------

# A few notes: This uses less-secured apps by default for GMail, so I would
# not recommend using this script from an email account you care about.
#
# To enable less-secured apps with GMail, go to the following link:
#   https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps?utm_source=google-account&utm_medium=web
# Please note that it may take a few minutes for these changes to register.
#
# If you would like to use this script with GMail on a secured account,
# please use the GMail API.
#   To install the GMail API, run:
#       pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client
#   Next, substitute the logic below with code adapted from here:
#       https://medium.com/lyfepedia/sending-emails-with-gmail-api-and-python-49474e32c81f
# To use the GMail API you will have to create a workspace admin account for yourself,
# which costs a little something every year.
